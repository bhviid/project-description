# DMM Testing Repository

This is a git repository that can be used to test implementations of the Delta Maintainability Model ([DMM]), an approach to assess the maintainability of individual commits.

This repository contains a few simple files with focused modifications, which have a predictable effect on the DMM values of these commits.

This repository is used for testing the OSS DMM implementation that is part of [PyDriller].
