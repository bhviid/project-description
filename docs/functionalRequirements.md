**GitInsight**  is an application made for the course *Analysis, Design and Software Architecture* during autumn 2022 as part of the BSc in Software Development program at IT-University of Copenhagen. The project runs between week 43 and week 49. 

#### Functional requirements (week 43)
##### Software
* GitInsight is an application that allow users to get insight in the commit frequency and commit authors in their git repositories/projects locally.  
*  GitInsight should be a C#/.Net Core application. 
* Given a path to a repository as a command-line argument, the application should print the textual output to standard out.  
* GitInsight supports two modes: 
    * *frequency*. lists the number of frequency per day. 
    * *commit author*. lists the number of commits per day per author. 
##### Development
* The program should be developed iteratively, expanding the the software requirements each week. Requirements are subject to change throughout the development period. 
* Should be developed in an agile and test-driven manner.
